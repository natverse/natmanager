Description: Enables user to install different packages in the 'natverse' repository from scratch. 
    The rationale behind the utility of this package is as follows. The suite of packages encompassed by 'natverse' 
    helps in analysing neuroanatomical data ranging from a variety of species like the nematode worm to the mouse brain.
    The principal problem while installing the core 'natverse' package is that it installs a lot of its friends 
    (dependencies, imports etc.) that are required for its proper functioning. Most of these friends are development 
    packages (which are also quite heavy) located in GITHUB. This in turn makes the installation of 'natverse' to 
    have a lot of API calls to the GITHUB, however GITHUB has a limit of 60 requests per hour for unauthenticated 
    requests. Hence for the unauthenticated user, the installation would fail if it was done directly.
    The proper way to fix this problem would be to set the GITHUB_PAT to make the request authenticated.
    Hence, to make the installation of 'natverse' easier from the end user perspective (who are not well versed in R 
    or in GITHUB), we have developed this package. This package will act as a wrapper that will set the  GITHUB_PAT 
    and will handhold the user to initiate the installation of the 'natverse' packages.
