The goal of natmanager is to streamline installation of packages from the 
natverse (NeuroAnatomy Toolbox) suite of R packages for computational neuroanatomy. See http://natverse.org/install/ for the full details.

```{r eval=FALSE, include=TRUE}
devtools::install_github('natverse/natmanager')

# install core packages to try out the core natverse
natmanager::install('core')

# Full "batteries included" installation with all packages
# It is recommended to have a GitHub account and personal access token (PAT) for this full
# batteries installation. However if you don't have one, then natmanager's default PAT will be used.
natmanager::install('natverse')

#you can also install non-natverse packages like below, this feature is useful if you want to avoid
#rate limiting issues from github and errors from warnings while installing packages:
natmanager::install(pkgs = 'flyconnectome/hemibrainr')
```
