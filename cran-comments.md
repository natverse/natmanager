This version of natmanager sees a change of maintainer

j.sridharrajan@gmail.com -> jefferis@gmail.com

The original maintainer confirmed this to CRAN on Wed 6 September 2023 and
the description has been modified accordingly.

In addition "pak" is a new dependency.

## Test environments

* Local R 4.3.1 on macosx
* winbuilder r-devel

## R CMD check results

0 errors | 0 warnings | 1 note

There are no reverse dependencies 

Win builder has just the one NOTE, as expected, re the new maintainer

Many thanks,

Greg Jefferis.
